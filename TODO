- get_choices() should use a cache (in T:C:Path), which is invalidated by 
  typing of BS or ordinary characters

- write a T:C:MultiPath, allowing entry or several paths (separated by blanks)
  ...and figure out how to efficiently implement CTRL-W in that situation

- works on Windows with Term::ReadKey?
  No, it doesn't. Need to investigate how to do single key reads on Win.
